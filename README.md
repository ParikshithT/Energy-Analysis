# Energy-Analysis
### Renewable Energy Data Analysis

This project focuses on leveraging Apache Node Red and various AWS services, including IoT Core, Glue, and RedShift, to collect, process, and analyze live sensor data in the context of a renewable energy initiative. The primary goal of the project is to enhance data quality and analysis capabilities, leading to improved operational efficiency.
Project Highlights

Renewable Energy Project Leadership: Led a team in the implementation of a renewable energy project, which involved the integration of Apache Node Red and AWS services to manage sensor data.

Data Collection and Processing: Utilized AWS IoT Core to gather real-time sensor data from various renewable energy sources. The collected data was then processed using AWS Glue, allowing for efficient data transformation and preparation for analysis.

Data Analysis and Insights: Employed AWS RedShift, a powerful data warehousing solution, to store and analyze the processed sensor data. By leveraging RedShift's advanced querying capabilities, valuable insights were extracted, contributing to a deeper understanding of the renewable energy system's performance.

Anomaly Detection Models: Developed and deployed anomaly detection models, specifically the Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM algorithms, using AWS SageMaker. These models played a crucial role in identifying irregularities or anomalies in sensor data, enabling proactive maintenance and optimization strategies.

Operational Efficiency Improvement: The successful implementation of anomaly detection models resulted in a significant 25% improvement in operational efficiency. By promptly identifying and addressing sensor irregularities, the project contributed to the overall stability and effectiveness of the renewable energy system.
